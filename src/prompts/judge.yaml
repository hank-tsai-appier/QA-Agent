  Also, has the current UI todo been completed in this step?
  Answer with a JSON: {{ "success": true or false, "todo_completed": true or false, "reason": "..."}}

  - Set "success" to true ONLY if all todos are completed and the overall goal is achieved
  - Set "todo_completed" to true if the current step successfully completed a todo item
